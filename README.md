## üìñ Documentation
If using Cloudflare Zaraz: [Custom MC docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/advanced/load-custom-managed-component/#docs-content)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If running Counterscale on the same zone as the site running Zaraz, you will get 522 HTTP errors because of a security limitation that prevents Cloudflare Workers from making requests to the same zone. To fix this, you will need to run Counterscale on a different zone than the site running Zaraz. [Question on Cloudflare Discord](https://discord.com/channels/595317990191398933/1200687018477359124/1200689850202992681)


 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tool Settings

> Settings are used to configure the tool in a Component Manager config file

### Site ID `string` _required_

`siteId` can be practically any string. It is used to identify the site in the Counterscale system. You can find it in the Counterscale dashboard.

### API Base URL `string` _required_

`apiBaseUrl` is the base URL of the Counterscale API. If you have Counterscale on its own domain it may look like `https://stats.example.com/`. If you have Counterscale on a route of your own domain it may look like `https://example.com/api/counterscale/`. Either way, the URL should point to the Counterscale API with the `collect` endpoint.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Building and Deploying
CI/CD GitHub Actions are setup to automate the build and deploy process. You will need to complete the following steps [based on the Workers docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/ci-cd) to get it setup:
- Create an Actions secret called `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` with a Cloudflare API token that has permission to edit Workers (use the `Edit Workers` template)
- Create an Actions secret called `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` with your Cloudflare account ID
